Task: Get yourself familiar with Copilot inline code and Copilot chat. Try out Slash commands

```cpp
//help
```
together with `Strg` + `Alt` + `Enter` and ask Copilot some questions about code / coding.ch

## Scenario 1️⃣: Create interest calculator without compound interest

## Scenario 2️⃣: Create interest calculator with compound interest

## Scenario 3️⃣: Build simple unittest
