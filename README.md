# GCH-CPlusPlus

## Prerequisites 

Before we start our code, we need to install some dependencies/extensions.

For this CodeLab, you need to install the following extentions:

- [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) 
- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
- [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) (will install automatically)

Once installed, you can open the chat function via clicking on that chat symbol in the left side bar.

To use GitHub Copilot, you must have an active subscription for GitHub Copilot in your personal account, or you need to be assigned a seat by your organization. Sign up for a [GitHub Copilot free trial](https://github.com/settings/copilot) in your personal account.
