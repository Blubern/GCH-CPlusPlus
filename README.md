# GCH C++ (VS Code & GitHub Codespaces)

This is a repository for a GitHub Copilot Demo for C++

## ‚öíÔ∏èWhat are we building
We are building a interest calculator together with a unittest. 

## Step 0Ô∏è‚É£: Prerequisites
1. **Clone** or **Fork** this Repository 
2. Open **GitHub Codespaces or VS Code**    
2.1 The demo can also be run in other IDEs. However, the hints are only given for GitHub Codespaces and Visual Studio Code.     
3. Please install the following extentions.     
3.1 [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)     
3.2 [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)    
3.3 [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) (will install automatically) 
4. Get yourself familiar with GitHub Copilot.

## Scenario 1Ô∏è‚É£: Understanding an existing file
As a software engineer, you often need to understand code written by others. The first scenario shows you how to use the /explain and the /fix command of Copilot.

## Scenario 2Ô∏è‚É£: Creating Code
In the second scenario, you will build a compound interest calculator. You will see how fast you can generate code.
## Scenario 3Ô∏è‚É£: Building unit tests 
At last, you will build unit tests for the compound interest calculator using Copilot. You may want to use the /tests command for this. 

Test different scenarios such as:
- Calculating interest for different principal amounts
- Calculating interest for different interest rates
- Checking that the calculated interest matches the expected result


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Hints and Solutions
In case you feel stuck, you may want to reach out to the hints or solution folder. There, you can find helpful tipps and bugfixes, which may help you.

## üó®Ô∏è Remember: Context is key
Copilot cannot read you mind. Try to be precise in your wording. Also, you want to use the **@-Command** to provide better context and the **/-Command** to make the task clear.
