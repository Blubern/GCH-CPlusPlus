## Compile C++
You might need to install C++ via terminal. For this type:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install g++ -y
```

In order to execute a file, you first need to compile it and then execute the new, resulting file. Make sure you are in the right path in your terminal:
```bash
g++ -o outputName sourceFile.cpp
./outputName
```
